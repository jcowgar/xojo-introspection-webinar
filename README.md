Xojo binary projects for the Xojo Webinar on Introspection originally given
on 9/30/2014.

* **copy.xojo_binary_project** contains copy, clone, and JSON serialization examples.
* **gui.xojo_binary_project** contains the PopulateGui and GuiToObject examples.
* **options.xojo_binary_project** contains the OptionParser example which uses attributes
  and other methods of Introspection to replace boiler plate code and provide compile time
  checking for options.

`OptionParser` is maintained separately, although included in the options project. If you
want up-to-date `OptionParser` code, please visit
